# Payroll-ByteMy

A comprehensive payroll management system with advanced date calculation and role-based access control.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Overview

Payroll-ByteMy is a full-featured payroll management system built with:

- Next.js (App Router) for frontend and API
- Clerk for authentication
- Hasura GraphQL for database operations
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Project Structure

Payroll Cycles and Processing Rules
This system handles various payroll cycle types with specific date calculation rules:

### 1. Weekly Payroll

- Frequency: Weekly
- Date Type: Day of Week (DOW)
- Date Value: 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 7 = Saturday
- Business Day Rule: Previous Business Day

### 2. Fortnightly Payroll

- Frequency: Every two weeks
- Timing: Specific day of the week
- Week Assignment: Week A (first week of January) or Week B (second week of January)
- Date Value: 1-7 (Sunday-Saturday)
- Business Day Rule: Previous Business Day

### 3. Bi-Monthly Payroll

- Frequency: Twice per month
- Date Types:
  - Start of Month (SOM): 1st and 15th with Next Business Day rule
  - End of Month (EOM): 30th and 15th with Previous Business Day rule
- February Exception: Use 14th instead of 15th for both SOM and EOM

### 4. Monthly Payroll

- Frequency: Monthly
- Date Types:
  - Start of Month (SOM): Uses Next Business Day rule
  - End of Month (EOM): Uses Previous Business Day rule
  - Fixed Date: Uses Previous Business Day rule
- Fixed Date uses a day of month as Date Value, EOM and SOM don't use it

### 5. Quarterly Payroll

- Frequency: Quarterly (March, June, September, December)
- Same rules as Monthly Payroll

## EFT Processing Rules

### 1. Processing Lead Time

- `processing_days_before_eft` determines how many days before the EFT date processing occurs
- If the processing date falls on a weekend/holiday, adjust to the Previous Business Day

### 2. EFT Date Adjustment

- If the EFT date is changed, the payroll processing date must be recalculated

## Key Terms

- **DOW (Day of Week)**: Specific day of the week
- **SOM (Start of Month)**: First day of the month
- **EOM (End of Month)**: Last day of the month
- **Fixed Date**: Predetermined date in the month
- **Previous Business Day**: The business day before the scheduled date
- **Next Business Day**: The business day after the scheduled date
- **EFT**: Electronic Funds Transfer for employee wages
- **processing_days_before_eft**: Time between payroll processing and EFT date

## Formatting and Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use single quotes for strings
- Use consistent type imports with `import type { Type } from 'module'`
- Follow import order: builtin > external > internal > parent/sibling > index
- Use interface for type definitions
- Use arrow functions for components and handlers

### GraphQL Standards

- All fragments are defined in fragments directory
- Fragment files follow naming convention: `entityFragment.ts`
- Fragment constants use pattern: `ENTITY_FRAGMENT`
- Fragment names in GraphQL follow: `EntityFragment`
- Always use fragments in queries instead of inline field selection
- Import fragments from the correct relative path: `../../fragments/fileName`

### Component Standards

- Component files follow naming convention: `component-name.tsx`
- Export components as named exports
- Use shadcn/ui patterns for UI components
- Use consistent props naming and ordering
- Document components with JSDoc or separate markdown files

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the project's color scheme defined in globals.css
- Use cn() utility for conditional class names
- Support both light and dark themes

### File Structure

- Keep related code in the same directory
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use index files for exporting multiple components
- Add relative path comments to the top of files

## Utility Scripts

- `npm run check-fragments` - Validates correct GraphQL fragment usage
- `npm run standardize-imports` - Updates import paths to match conventions
- `npm run add-relative-paths` - Adds file path comments to source files

## API Endpoints

### Holiday Sync Endpoint

```http
POST /api/holidays/sync
```

Synchronizes holiday data from external sources. Requires authentication and admin privileges.

## Database Operations

To create a schema dump:

```bash
hasura metadata export --project hasura/
```

To dump specific tables:

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d payroll -t "public.holidays" > holidays_dump.sql
```

## Authentication

The system uses Clerk for authentication, which is integrated with Hasura for permissions:

```typescript
// Example of authentication middleware
export const middleware = (request: NextRequest) => {
  const { userId } = getAuth(request);
  if (!userId && !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/public')) {
    return redirectToSignIn({ returnBackUrl: request.url });
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
};
```

## Component Import Patterns

There are multiple ways to import components in this project:

```typescript
// Import from main barrel file
import { Button, Card, Alert } from "@/components";

// Or import from specific category
import { Button, Card } from "@/components/ui";
import { ClientCard } from "@/components/client";
```

psql "postgres://neondb_owner:npg_WavFRZ1lEx4U@ep-black-sunset-a7wbc0zq-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" -f list_tables.sql > schema_reference.txt
